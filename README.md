# weed-classification
The purpose of developing this project is to identify the weeds and classify them.

For example, farmers can upload an image of some weed and this displays the name of the weed along with the probability.

The dataset used is taken from kaggle and the data pre-processing has been done initially for the better results.
Later, the model has been built using DL and tkinter has been used for the GUI to display the name of the classified weed.
